I'm a manager for technology development with over 14 years of experience in developing and deploying IT strategies, enterprise application, customer relationship management, analytics, web development, mobile application and customer engagement. But when you get right down to it, I'm much more --- I'm a full stack developer, an entrepreneur, a project manager, data scientist, a UX designer and a team leader (and good party planner, so I've been told).

In a nutshell, my passion for technical details is coupled with a love for big-picture planning and daily operational management. I'm not the developer who just wants to write code. I'm the tech geek who actually wants to build ideas --- and plan, and lead. This is what I do best and love most.
