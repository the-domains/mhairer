description: "I’m a manager for technology development with over 14 years of experience in developing and deploying IT strategies, enterprise application, customer relationship management, analytics, web development, mobile application and customer engagement. But when you get right down to it, I'm much more — I'm a full stack developer, an entrepreneur, a project manager, data scientist, a UX designer and a team leader (and good party planner, so I’ve been told)."
